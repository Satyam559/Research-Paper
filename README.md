India’s general elections, notably in 2019 and 2024, have witnessed a transformative shift with the integration of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) into campaign strategies. This paper examines how these technologies have been utilized for voter profiling, sentiment analysis, predictive modeling, and AI-driven tools like chatbots and deepfakes. Through qualitative analysis of secondary sources and expert insights, it explores their applications, ethical implications, and future potential. Visual aids, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and maps, are described to illustrate key trends, including the growth in data collection and regional campaign impacts. However, the rapid adoption of AI in politics raises significant ethical and regulatory challenges, including data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and the potential for political manipulation. Addressing these issues requires robust data protection laws, algorithmic transparency, and ethical guidelines. The article proposes policy recommendations to ensure the ethical use of AI in Indian politics, emphasizing the need for comprehensive data protection, fair AI algorithms, accountability mechanisms, and public awareness initiatives. The study highlights the dual nature of these technologies—enhancing electoral efficiency while raising concerns about privacy, misinformation, and inequality—and offers recommendations for ethical governance.
